#safeJs Readme

##Description
This javascript library is intended to provide some checking to the javascript language. Although extremely flexible, certain features of the language, or of some common standards around the language can throw errors silently, making it harder to debug code as well as to enforce certain specifications

For now, safeJs will introduce type checking for javascript functions as well as providing an easy way to wrap promise callbacks with an appropriate context. More features will come as I come up with them I guess?
